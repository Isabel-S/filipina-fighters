					<p>Since 2016, Filipina-American journalist Maria Ressa, founder of popular Filipino news site Rappler and now Nobel Laureate, has faced an onslaught of online violence.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p>Death threats. Rape threats. Doxxing. Racist, sexist, and misogynistic abuse and memes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="3">
					<p>This was due to her reportings on Philippine president at the time, Rodrigo Duterte (Add Years of his presidency here). When Duterte held presidency, Ressa and Rappler published had written numerous investigative reports investigative including “Propaganda War: Weaponizing the Internet” on Duterte's use of online disinformation to push his political agendas, reports on his actions such as extrajudicial killings resulting from the drug war, and findings of corruption within his government administration.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="4">
					<p>In response, pPhrases such as “presstitute”, which was a term created by pro-Duterte blogger, blogger Mocha Uson (who would go on to become the president’s Communications Assistant Secretary), and tags like #ArrestMariaRessa frequents went viral across Facebook and Twitter. 14% of all online abuse against Ressa wasere misogynistic and sexist in nature., targeting her physical appearance (skin condition) and manipulating photographs depicting her head associated with male genitalia. </p>

					<p>This created an “enabling environment for Ressa’s persecution and prosecution in the Philippines''. Around 2020, she faced multiple charges and arrest warrants, which were both ruled by and in turn further fueled the negative narrative created about her online.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p>	Her abuse speaks to the Philippine’s struggle for press freedom and the normalized sexism in the country amidst the rise of social media and anti-news agenda introduced by former populist president Duterte. Gendered harassment in journalists is “too often dismissed as something that required acceptance as ‘unintended consequence’ of online engagement with audiences” . However, Ressa’s case demonstrates that online hate has significant real life consequences. </p>

                <p>Ressa refused to be silenced; her story is unique in that not only did she fight back, she fought back with data.  With a team of researchers she gathered thousands of Twitter and Facebook posts and used data science techniques to uncover that the online violence against her were personal attacks, often with gendered language, and were organized, “orchestrated attacks” 5 by netizens and government officials.
